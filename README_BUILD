This project contains two ANT scripts here: 
One is for android and the other is for native java library

#four lines below might not work
#To configure java-build.xml as default builder for this repo, in eclipse,
#1) right click the project (FinderLib) -> properties -> search for Builders
#2) select new -> ANT builder -> in main, select the correct location of java-build.xml
#3) check your newly created builder at Builders (unchecked the rest too, especially android-build one)

To run:
1) Right click at java-build.xml -> run as ANT build -> it should output bin/finderlib-java.jar
(The pre-built version should be in lib folder)

To include it into other project:
1) Add finderlib-java.jar and utils-java.jar as libraries in build path

NOTE1: you should not select both builds since Java jar will contain extra folders.

NOTE2: android-build relies on lib/utils-android.jar and vice versa for java-build
To re-compile utils-android(or java).jar, 
move everything inside com.sprout.finderlib.utils.android package to com.sprout.finderlib.utils
and build com.sprout.finderlib.utils as jar library
