This project contains two ANT scripts here: 
1 for android and the other for native java library

To import java-build.xml, in eclipse,
1) right click the project (FinderLib) -> properties -> search for Builders
2) select new -> ANT builder -> in main, select the correct location of java-build.xml
3) check your newly created builder at Builders (unchecked the rest too, especially android-build one)

To run:
1) Right click at java-build.xml -> run as ANT build
-> it should output bin/finderlib-java.jar
Then, you can export it to include into your project

NOTE1: you should not select both builds since Java jar will contain extra folders.

NOTE2: android-build relies on lib/utils-android.jar and vice versa for java-build
To re-generate utils-android(or java).jar, move StopWatch.java to temporary folder first,
then, rename com.sprout.finderlib.utils.android package to com.sprout.finderlib.utils
and build it as jar library
